# Data Science Best Practices with Pandas Walkthrough

Here I am reviewing and picking up some tips for using Pandas I have to practice a lot wih each aspect of Data Science and this was a very good intermediate guide. I was happy to see that many of my solutions were the solutions given and then I learned key tips for the moments when I really struggled to get the results I was looking for.

Kevin Markham is a very patient and generous teacher. I would love to do more work with him and his materials. For me many of the lessons learned were review and reinforcement. But it was refreshing to walk through each challenge and take on a problem before getting working on it as a class.
